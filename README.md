# 1. Rat in a Maze

## Description

This C++ program generates mazes with a specified size (n) and a given percentage of walls. Users can attempt to find a path from the start ('S') to the end ('E') point in the randomly generated maze. The program provides an interactive menu for users to choose actions such as printing the path, generating a new puzzle, or exiting the game.

## Features

1. **Maze Generation:** The program creates mazes with customizable size and wall density.

2. **Path Finding:** Users can attempt to find a path from the start to the end point in the generated maze.

3. **Interactive Menu:** The program offers a menu-driven interface for users to perform actions such as printing the path, generating a new puzzle, or exiting the game.

## Notes

- Ensure a C++ compiler is installed on your system.

- The maze generation involves randomization, resulting in varying levels of difficulty.

- The path-finding algorithm may not always find a solution, especially in mazes with a high percentage of walls.

- Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your preferences or integrate additional features.
